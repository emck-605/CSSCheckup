        <p>Here, I'll forgive my thoughts now</p>
        <p>Steer it, 'cause I forget the dots now</p>
        <p>Was it all any more faded after all?</p>
        <p>I don't know, I don't know, I don't know</p>
        <p>Are you sure, did you call, did we ever really talk?</p>
        <p>I don't know, I don't know, I don't know</p>
        <p>I don't know, I don't...</p>
        <p>Dear, I wouldn't bet your heart down</p>
        <p>Clear, but I couldn't get my head around</p>
        <p>Was it all any more faded after all?</p>
        <p>I don't know, I don't know, I don't know</p>
        <p>Are you sure, did you call, did we ever really talk?</p>
        <p>I don't know, I don't know, I don't know</p>
        <p>I've been awake in every state line</p>
        <p>Dyin' to make it last us a lifetime</p>
        <p>Tryin' to shake that it's all on an incline</p>
        <p>Find me a way, I'll be yours in a landslide</p>
